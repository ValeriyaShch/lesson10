              In 1971, Carolyn and Roger Perron move their family into a
              dilapidated Rhode Island farm house and soon strange things start
              happening around it with escalating nightmarish terror. In
              desperation, Carolyn contacts the noted paranormal investigators,
              Ed and Lorraine Warren, to examine the house. What the Warrens
              discover is a whole area steeped in a satanic haunting that is now
              targeting the Perron family wherever they go. To stop this evil,
              the Warrens will have to call upon all their skills and spiritual
              strength to defeat this spectral menace at its source that
              threatens to destroy everyone involved.

              Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a top student at the FBI's
              training academy. Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to
              interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant
              psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind
              bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes
              that Lecter may have insight into a case and that Starling, as an
              attractive young woman, may be just the bait to draw him out.
